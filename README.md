Supreme Court of the United States Timeline
-------------------------------------------
Renders a timeline of the Supreme Court's decisions.

Starting over with what I want this to look like.

A bar across the linking to other sections of the site.

The homepage will have two fields at the top, one for a start date, and one for an end date. (F: a series of labels that can be marked for sorting, and a number of other filtering features)

When the user puts in the two dates, twelve cases will be displayed by default (F: customizable), six on each side of a line that cuts vertically down the page, evenly divided along the time interval specified by the user.

(F: Ajax for changing the timeline?)

Have the pseudocode for the main function on the front page.
1) Have ten random cases appear vertically stacked on the main timeline page. The ten random cases are put in sequential order by date.
2) Have the spaces for the user to put in a date range, and have that modify the randomized database query.
3) Have hidden options for other searches. Details to come.

No CSS? This looks like shit!

Data visualizations for sway of the court's ideology, etc

Stealing all the things from Cornell with webscraping and analyzing citations for a ranking on the timeline

Aaaand... that's how far I want to get right now.
